AT client firmware is valuable resource for platforms with not enough resources for running a full network client with SSL cryptography. It is a Serial-to-Vizibles converter, secure, and very easy to use, so if you have a serial port on your main processor and some power to feed an ESP8266 you can have access to [Vizibles](https://vizibles.com)
For using the AT client you can compile this project for your board, or just download and burn the [precompiled version](https://github.com/Enxine/ViziblesArduino/releases/) in your module. This version is tested to work on ESP-01 and ESP-WROOM-02 modules, but is expected to work in any other with enough memory, since only the serial port is used as hardware resource.  

## AT commands available

####```AT+WIFICONNECT="<SSID>","<password>"\r\n```

Connect to the WiFi access point with the given SSID and password. This command must be used only once. After a power cycle the module will connect automatically to the same access point.
Returns ```OK``` on success or ```ERROR``` on error. 

####```AT+SETOPTIONS="<option name>","<option value>"[,...]\r\n```

Establishes basic communication options for the connection with the Vizibles platform. Minimum required options are a valid thing ID, Key ID, and Key Secret. For example: ```AT+SETOPTIONS="id","light-bulb","keyID","<YOUR_KEY_ID_HERE","keySecret","<YOUR_KEY_SECRET_HERE>"```
It is not possible tho change options while connected. So for changing an option please disconnect first.
Returns ```OK``` on success or ```ERROR``` on error.

####```AT+CONNECT[="<option name>","<option value>"[,...]]\r\n```

Connect to the Vizibles platform. The basic options for the connection can be set on this same command or previously using ```AT+SETOPTIONS```. For example: ```AT+CONNECT="id","light-bulb","keyID","<YOUR_KEY_ID_HERE","keySecret","<YOUR_KEY_SECRET_HERE>"```
Returns ```OK``` on success or ```ERROR``` on error. This command also returns ```+CONNECTED``` when it correctly connects to the Vizibles platform.

####```AT+UPDATE="<variable name>","<variable value>"[,...]\r\n```

Send an update for a variable to the cloud. For example: ```AT+UPDATE="light","on"\r\n```
Returns ```OK``` on success or ```ERROR``` on error.
 
####```AT+EXPOSE="<function name>"\r\n```

Exposes a control function in the Vizibles platform. For example: ```AT+EXPOSE="lightOn"``` 
Returns ```OK``` on success or ```ERROR``` on error. When the function is called from the platform it will result on a ```+THINGDO=``` in the serial port followed by the name of the function and all the provided parameters separated by comas and between quotation marks. In our example: ```+THINGDO="lightOn"```

####```AT+DISCONNECT\r\n```

Break any current connection with the Vizibles platform.
Returns ```OK``` on success or ```ERROR``` on error. This command also returns ```+DISCONNECTED``` when it correctly disconnects from the Vizibles platform.

####```AT+GETMAC\r\n```

Returns the MAC address of the WiFi interface. Mainly used for differentiating among different modules for the Thigh ID name. Returns the MAC address on the format ```+MAC=FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF``` or nothing if any error happens.

## Drivers for other platforms
