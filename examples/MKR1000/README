This directory contains the following examples:

* base-test: basic example that shows how to connect and Arduino MKR-1000 to
Vizibles and send data to the platform.

* temp-hum: it shows how to build a connected thermometer and higrometer using
an Arduino MKR-1000 with a KY-015 DHT11 sensor:

It also shows how to 'expose' a function, so that you can then create a control
to invoke that function passing it parameters from your dashboard.
